## Case Study Questions - Pizza Metrics
### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?
 ```sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizza_ordered
FROM customer_orders;
```
### Result:
| total_pizza_ordered |
| --- |
| 14 |

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_customer_orders
FROM customer_orders;
```
### Result:
| unique_customer_orders |
| --- |
| 10 |

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
```sql
SELECT runner_id, COUNT(order_id) AS succesful_deliveries
FROM runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```
### Result:
| runner_id |	succesful_deliveries |
| --- | --- |
| 1	| 4 |
| 2	| 3 |
| 3	| 1 |

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
```sql
SELECT p.pizza_name, COUNT(*) AS total_delivered
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN pizza_names p ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY p.pizza_name;
```
### Result:
| pizza_name	| total_delivered |
| --- | --- |
| Meat Lovers	| 9 |
| Vegetarian	| 3 |

### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN p.pizza_name = 'Vegetarian' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Vegetarian_order,
SUM(CASE WHEN p.pizza_name = 'Meat Lovers' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS MeatLovers_order
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN pizza_names p ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
```
### Result:
| customer_id	| Vegetarian_order | MeatLovers_order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 101	| 1	| 2 |
| 102	| 1	| 2 |
| 103	| 1	| 3 |
| 104	| 0	| 3 |
| 105	| 1	| 0 |

### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
```sql
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY pizza_delivered DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
#### Result:
| order_id | pizza_delivered |
| --- | --- |
| 4	| 3 |

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL OR extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS order_with_change,
SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NULL AND extras IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS order_with_no_change
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
```
### Result:
| customer_id	| order_with_change	| order_with_no_change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 101	| 0	| 2 |
| 102	| 0	| 3 |
| 103	| 3	| 0 |
| 104	| 2	| 1 |
| 105	| 1	| 0 |

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
```sql
SELECT c.order_id, COUNT(*) AS pizza_with_exclusions_and_extras
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
AND c.exclusions IS NOT NULL
AND c.extras IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.order_id;
```
### Result:
| order_id	| pizza_with_exclusions_and_extras |
| --- | --- |
| 10	| 1 |

### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_date) AS order_hour, COUNT(*) AS total_pizza_order
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY order_hour
ORDER BY order_hour;
```
### Result:
| order_hour	| total_pizza_order |
| --- | --- |
| 11	| 1 |
| 13	| 3 |
| 18	| 3 |
| 19	| 1 |
| 21	| 3 |
| 23	| 3 |

### 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
```sql
SELECT 
  WEEKDAY(order_date) AS weekday_number,
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY weekday_number
ORDER BY weekday_number;
```
### Result:
| weekday_number	| total_orders |
| --- | --- |
| 2	| 5 |
| 3	| 3 |
| 4	| 1 |
