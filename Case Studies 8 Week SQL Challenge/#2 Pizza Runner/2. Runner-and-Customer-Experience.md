## Case Study Questions - Runner and Customer Experience
1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

## Solutions:
### 1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(WEEK FROM registration_date) AS week_number,
COUNT(runner_id) AS runner_signed_up
FROM runners
WHERE registration_date >= '2021-01-01'
GROUP BY week_number
ORDER BY week_number;
```
#### Result:
| week_number | runner_signed_up |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 1 |

### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
```sql
SELECT ro.runner_id,
AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, co.order_date, ro.pickup_time)) AS avg_arrival_minutes
FROM runner_orders ro
JOIN customer_orders co ON ro.order_id = co.order_id
WHERE ro.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ro.runner_id;
```
### Result:
| runner_id | avg_arrival_minutes |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1         | 15.33               |
| 2         | 23.40               |
| 3         | 10.00               |

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
```sql
SELECT 
  co.order_id,
  COUNT(co.pizza_id) AS pizza_count,
  CAST(REPLACE(ro.duration, 'minutes', '') AS UNSIGNED) AS delivery_duration
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL OR ro.cancellation = ''
GROUP BY co.order_id, ro.duration;
```
### Result:
| order_id | pizza_count | delivery_duration |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1        | 1           | 32                |
| 2        | 1           | 27                |
| 3        | 2           | 20                |
| 4        | 3           | 40                |
| 5        | 1           | 15                |
| 7        | 1           | 25                |
| 8        | 1           | 15                |
| 10       | 2           | 10                |


### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
```sql
SELECT co.customer_id, ROUND(AVG(ro.distance), 2)  AS avg_distance
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY co.customer_id;
```
### Result:
| customer_id | avg_distance |
|-------------|--------------|
| 101         | 20           |
| 102         | 16.73        |
| 103         | 23.4         |
| 104         | 10           |
| 105         | 25           |

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
```sql
SELECT
MAX(duration)-MIN(duration) AS delivery_time_difference
FROM runner_orders
WHERE duration IS NOT NULL;
```
### Result:
# delivery_time_difference
30

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
```sql
SELECT runner_id, order_id,
ROUND(distance/(duration/60), 2) AS avg_speed_kmh
FROM runner_orders
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL AND duration IS NOT NULL;
```
### Result:
| runner_id | order_id | avg_speed_kmh |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 1         | 1        | 37.5           |
| 1         | 2        | 44.44          |
| 1         | 3        | 40.2           |
| 2         | 4        | 35.1           |
| 3         | 5        | 40             |
| 2         | 7        | 60             |
| 2         | 8        | 93.6           |
| 1         | 10       | 60             |


### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
```sql
SELECT runner_id,
COUNT(pickup_time) AS delivered_orders,
COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
ROUND(100*COUNT(pickup_time)/COUNT(*)) AS delivery_succes_percentage
FROM runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```
### Result:
| runner_id | delivered_orders | total_orders | delivery_succes_percentage |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| 1         | 4                | 4            | 100                         |
| 2         | 3                | 4            | 75                          |
| 3         | 1                | 2            | 50                          |
