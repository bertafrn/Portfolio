## Case Study Questions - Ingredient Optimisation
1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
2. What was the most commonly added extra?
3. What was the most common exclusion?
4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
    - `Meat Lovers`
    - `Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef`
    - `Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon`
    - `Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers`
5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the `customer_orders` table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients.
   For example: `"Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"`
6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

## Solutions
### 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
```sql
SELECT 
    pn.pizza_name,
    pt.topping_name
FROM pizza_recipes pr
JOIN pizza_names pn ON pr.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, pr.toppings);
```
### Result:
| pizza_name | topping_name |
| --- | --- |
| Meat Lovers |	Bacon |
| Vegetarian | Cheese |

### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?
```sql
SELECT pt.topping_name,
COUNT(*) AS extra_counted
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, co.extras)
WHERE co.extras IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY pt.topping_name
ORDER BY extra_counted DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
### Result:
| topping_name | extra_counted |
| --- | --- |
| Bacon	| 4 |

### 3. What was the most common exclusion?
```sql
SELECT pt.topping_name,
COUNT(*) AS exclusions_counted
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, co.exclusions)
WHERE co.exclusions IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY pt.topping_name
ORDER BY exclusions_counted DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
### Result:
| topping_name | exclusions_counted |
| --- | --- |
| Cheese | 4 |

### 4.  Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following
```sql
SELECT co.order_id, co.customer_id
			CONCAT(
            pn.pizza_name,
            CASE
				WHEN co.exclusions IS NOT NULL AND co.exclusions <> ''
                THEN CONCAT(' - Exclude', GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT pt1.topping_name ORDER BY pt1.topping_name SEPARATOR ' ,'))
                ELSE ''
			END,
            CASE
				WHEN co.extras IS NOT NULL AND co.extras <> ''
                THEN CONCAT(' - Extra',GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT pt2.topping_name ORDER BY pt2.topping_name SEPARATOR ' ,'))
                ELSE ''
			END ) AS custom_orders
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
LEFT JOIN pizza_toppings pt1 ON FIND_IN_SET(pt1.topping_id, co.exclusions)
LEFT JOIN pizza_toppings pt2 ON FIND_IN_SET(pt2.topping_id, co.extras)
GROUP BY co.order_id, co.customer_id;
```
# Result:
| order_id | customer_id | custom_orders                                               |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | 101         | Meatlovers                                                      |
| 2        | 101         | Meatlovers                                                      |

| 10       | 104         | Meatlovers - Exclude BBQ Sauce, Mushrooms - Extra Bacon, Cheese |

### 5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the `customer_orders` table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients.
```sql
SELECT
    co.order_id,
    CONCAT(
        pn.pizza_name, ': ',
        GROUP_CONCAT(
            CASE 
                WHEN FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, co.extras) THEN CONCAT('2x', pt.topping_name)
                ELSE pt.topping_name
            END
            ORDER BY 
                CASE WHEN FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, co.extras) THEN pt.topping_name ELSE pt.topping_name END
            SEPARATOR ', '
        )
    ) AS ingredients_list
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_recipes pr ON co.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, pr.toppings)
GROUP BY co.order_id;
```
### Result:
| order_id | ingredients_list                                                                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 2        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |

| 7        | Vegetarian: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomato Sauce, Tomatoes                               |
| 8        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 9        | Meatlovers: 2xBacon, 2xChicken, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                |
| 10       | Meatlovers: 2xBacon, 2xCheese, BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami |

### 6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?
```sql
SELECT 
    pt.topping_name,
    COUNT(*) + 
    SUM(CASE WHEN FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, co.extras) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_quantity
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
JOIN pizza_recipes pr ON co.pizza_id = pr.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_toppings pt ON FIND_IN_SET(pt.topping_id, pr.toppings)
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL OR ro.cancellation = ''
GROUP BY pt.topping_name
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
```
### Result:
| topping_name | total_quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Bacon	| 22 |
| Cheese | 6 |
