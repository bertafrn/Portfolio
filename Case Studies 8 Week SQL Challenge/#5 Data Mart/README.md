## Introduction
Data Mart is Dannyâ€™s newest business. After managing international operations for his online supermarket specializing in fresh produce, he now needs your help to analyze sales performance.

In June 2020, Data Mart made major supply chain changes by switching to sustainable packaging at every stage, from farm to customer.

Danny wants to understand how this change affected sales across different business areas. He needs answers to these key questions:
- What was the measurable impact of the June 2020 changes?
- Which platform, region, segment, and customer type were most affected?
- How can future sustainability changes be introduced with minimal sales impact?

## Dataset
The columns are pretty self-explanatory based on the column names but here are some further details about the dataset:
  1. Data Mart has international operations using a multi-`region` strategy
  2. Data Mart has both, a retail and online `platform` in the form of a Shopify store front to serve their customers
  3. Customer `segment` and `customer_type` data relates to personal age and demographics information that is shared with           Data  Mart
  4. `transactions` is the count of unique purchases made through Data Mart and sales is the actual dollar amount of                purchases.
