## Introduction
Subscription-based businesses are very popular, and Danny saw a gap in the market. He wanted to create a streaming service focused only on food-related contentâ€”like Netflix, but just for cooking shows!

In 2020, Danny and his team launched Foodie-Fi, offering monthly and annual subscriptions that give customers unlimited access to exclusive food videos from around the world.

Danny built Foodie-Fi with a data-driven approach, ensuring that all future investments and features would be based on data. This case study explores how subscription data can help answer key business questions.

## Dataset
This case study includes two main datasets:
### 1. `Plans`
  - `Basic Plan`: Limited access, only streaming, $9.90/month.
  - `Pro Plan`: Unlimited streaming & downloads, $19.90/month or $199/year.
  - `Trial Plan`: 7-day free trial, which automatically switches to the Pro plan unless canceled or changed.
  - `Churn Plan`: When a customer cancels, they are placed on this plan (no charge), but they keep access until the billing         period ends.

### 2. `Subscriptions`
If a customer downgrades or cancels, the current plan remains active until the period ends.
Upgrades from Basic to Pro or Annual Pro take effect immediately.
When a customer cancels, they keep access until the billing cycle ends, but the cancellation date is recorded as the start of the Churn plan.
