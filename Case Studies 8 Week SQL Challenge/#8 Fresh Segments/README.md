## Introduction
Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

Danny has asked for your assistance to analyse aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.

## Dataset
Key datasets for this case study :
1. `Interest Metrics`:
   - Contains aggregated interest data for a major client of Fresh Segments, which represents a large portion of their             customers.
   - Each record shows how a specific `interest_id` performed, based on customer clicks and interactions with targeted ads.

3. `Interest Map`:
   - A mapping table that links `interest_id` to its corresponding interest details.
   - Needs to be joined with the Interest Metrics table to get the `interest_name` and summary information.
